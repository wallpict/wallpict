<p>Season 11 was one of the best in years, and it gives me hope for season 12. 2) season 3 with only 16 episodes, season 3 was the shortest season of supernatural.

<p>And if the series had ended with the season 5 finale, swan song, then the show could’ve had one of the best series finales ever, in my opinion, with a few adjustments. Supernatural�s best episodes tend to be the ones that really delve into sam and dean�s complex relationship, and the season 10 finale does just that. This season, in addition to having some of the best episodes, is responsible for expanding all the mythologies found in the series, overcoming folklore and horror to bring the idea of antagonistic creatures. The supernatural season 2 premiere is certainly an important episode and one of the best for the season. Towards the end of season 2, as the series started to grow in confidence, supernatural started to do slightly more experimental episodes that took us away from the straightforward “sam and dean.
