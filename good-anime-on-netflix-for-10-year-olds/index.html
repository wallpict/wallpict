<p>:) we are watching haikyu! It’s one of the best anime shows on netflix, and not just in my opinion!imdb users give it a total of 8.8/10!. I.e the boobs and underwear nonsense. For her age and gender, the dubbed sailor moon is great! Here are the best teen shows on netflix.</p>
<h3 id="my-6-year-old-read-the-subtitles-for-the-first-episode-of-this-one">My 6 year old read the subtitles for the first episode of this one.</h3><p>But i don’t care for it. In this kids anime, a herbivore raises a tyrannosaurus and as a result, he grows up scared of other dinosaurs. Inspired by the magical girl anime, sailor moon, it largely revolves around the five magical girl warriors called pretty cures. But i told them despite the anime�s looks, it isn�t age appropriate. It’s not a bad anime.</p>
