A year has passed since tohru honda began living in the souma residence, and she has since created stronger relationships with its inhabitants shigure, kyou, and yuki. Season 2 introduced new characters like kureno, the rooster of the zodiac, and student council members machi and kakeru manabe. Natsuki takaya�s hit shojo manga series fruits basket was wildly popular during its publication in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it inspired an anime at the same time. I�m loving how the characters are evolving and also all of the revelations that are coming about. Pin by SYL on フルーツバスケット幻影天使.</p>
