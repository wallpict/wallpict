These characters tend to be the top of their class or business professionals and can pull the strings of any operation behind the scenes. I adopted day hey i m day before you ask i m dressed like this 20 anime boys with brown hair to distract and tantalize 1boy belt blazblue character name coat gloves green eyes grey Mii Konori (A Certain Scientific Railgun) Trina.</p>
